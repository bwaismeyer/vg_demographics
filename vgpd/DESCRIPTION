Title: Video Game Protagonist Demographics EDA
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: as.person(c("Brian Waismeyer <bwaismeyer@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"))
Description: This package contains data and functions to support exploratory
    analysis of the characteristics of video game protagonists. The data are
    not exhaustive nor should they be assumed to be representative of video
    games in general. The game titles and non-character details were largely
    extracted from the Steam API and so are limited to the platforms served by
    Steam (PC/Mac/Linux) and are shaped by Valve's business objectives and
    probably many other factors. Please see the package README and associated
    package vignettes for details on how the data were constructed and
    suggested data uses and limitations.
